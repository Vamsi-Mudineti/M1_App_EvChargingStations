Around 1832, Robert Anderson develops the first crude electric vehicle, But upto date we are using IC engines vehicle.
why because 

i)speed 

ii)charging stations. 

iii)Cost

Present automobile technology can achieve the top speed (120 rpm)by E vehicle(Ev's) also but they are not utilizing because of power station and its cost of
but present market we get ebikes 40000 rupess cost so price is also a not a big deal. the only one problem is charging stations.
so my idea is to bulid a charging station.
